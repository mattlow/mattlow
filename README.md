### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a physicist working at the University of Pittsburgh in the [Particle Physics and Cosmology group](https://www.pittpacc.pitt.edu/).  My previous institutions include the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/sns) and the [University of Chicago](https://physics.uchicago.edu/).

- I have over [10 years of research experience](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1061156) in a variety of fields including: collider physics, cosmology, model building, and quantum information theory.

### Research Interests

- Using quantum information science and quantum computing to study quantum correlations between particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider including [quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17696), [Bell nonlocality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672), and [quantum discord](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21158).  My work includes using tools from quantum information for quantifying the [distance between quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03311) and using [transformer networks to solve an underconstrained set of equations for neutrino momenta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01496).

- Addressing tensions between cosmological datasets, the most well-known tensions being the Hubble tension and the S8 tension, with the [twin Higgs model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04317) and with the [Nnaturalness model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19224).

### Other Projects

- In 2018 [I analyzed workout results](https://crossfitnumbers.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/2018crossfitopen1/) from the [2018 Crossfit Open](https://games.crossfit.com/open/overview) with an eye towards correlations between physical characteristics of competitors whether those were correlated with above-average results in workouts with certain types of exercises.

- In 2016 [I wrote a page that dynamically generates fake (but surprisingly realistic) paper titles using a context-free grammar](https://snarxiv.org/hep-750gev/).
